the connection between hurricane sandy and global warming,REFUTES
"there are several ways in which human-caused global warming contributed to the damage caused by hurricane sandy - by causing higher sea levels (bigger storm surges and flooding), warmer oceans (a stronger hurricane), and more moisture in the air (more flooding).",SUPPORTS
