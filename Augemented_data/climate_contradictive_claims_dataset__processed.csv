solar panels don't work in cold or cloudy climates,REFUTES
"solar panels generate energy even in cloudy or cold conditions, with cold temperatures actually increasing solar panel efficiency by increasing voltage.",SUPPORTS
solar panels generate too much waste and will overwhelm landfills,REFUTES

solar projects harm biodiversity,REFUTES
"when applying best practices for project design, large-scale solar farms can sustain and even increase local biodiversity by replanting indigenous flowering species that benefit insects, mammals and ground nesting birds.",SUPPORTS

solar deployment would utilize a relatively small percentage of u.s. land when compared to the land currently being used for agriculture.,SUPPORTS
the connection between hurricane sandy and global warming,REFUTES
"there are several ways in which human-caused global warming contributed to the damage caused by hurricane sandy - by causing higher sea levels (bigger storm surges and flooding), warmer oceans (a stronger hurricane), and more moisture in the air (more flooding).",SUPPORTS
toxic heavy metals leach out from solar panels and pose a threat to human health,REFUTES
"the massachusetts department of energy resources has assessed that there is little, if any, risk of chemical releases to the environment during normal use, and that all materials in a solar panel are 'insoluble and non-volatile at ambient conditions,' and 'don't mix with water or vaporize into air.'",SUPPORTS
