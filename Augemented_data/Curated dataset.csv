"We have an estimated expiration date with climate change, you know its coming, but its also not as unstable as the society we live in. Collapse and war are the things that will doom us before climate change. And there is no stopping climate change, that snowball has been picking up momentum for a while. Scientists looking into it have said even if you stop everything today the temps would continue to rise another 40 to 100 years. Then settle at the new high temps for 1000 years.
