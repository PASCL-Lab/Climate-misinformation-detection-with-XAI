"Monsoons in China fail, the great rivers of Asia virtually dry up, and rainfall in central America falls by half.",NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
the Great Barrier Reef is in fine fettle,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
Medieval Warm Period was warmer than the climate warming today.,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
The carbon footprint on wind [energy] is significant.,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
Mr. Singer is a professor emeritus of environmental science at the University of Virginia.,SUPPORTS
"Concentrated in the atmosphere, these gases do not allow the warmth of the sun’s rays reflected by the earth to be dispersed in space.",SUPPORTS
"Renew­ables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area, slice and dice birds and bats, kill insects that are bird food, create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them, leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape.",NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free.,SUPPORTS

Unprecedented climate change has caused sea level at Sydney Harbour to rise approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years.,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
"The ocean is absorbing massive amounts of CO2, and is becoming more acidic as a result.",SUPPORTS
"For that, we have to work on other types of marine organisms so that we clearly understand what took place in the sediment over geological time”",NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
Reefs need carbon dioxide; it’s their basic food.,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
Urban and rural regions show the same warming trend.,SUPPORTS
"The worsening of tidal flooding in American coastal communities is largely a consequence of greenhouse gases from human activity, and the problem will grow far worse in coming decades, scientists reported Monday.",NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
"The melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely, the oceans would rise by six metres around the world, flooding many of the world’s largest cities.",SUPPORTS
