"This requires us to work towards avoiding catastrophic possibilities rather than looking at probabilities, as learning from mistakes is not an option when it comes to existential risks.",SUPPORTS
Global warming slowing down? Ironic study finds more CO2 has slightly cooled the planet,REFUTES
"The jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes.",SUPPORTS
Measurements indicating that 2017 had relatively more sea ice in the Arctic and less melting of glacial ice in Greenland casts scientific doubt on the reality of global warming.,REFUTES
The news of expanding Antarctic sea ice stole headlines from global warming alarmists who asserted Arctic sea ice had reached its lowest extent since 1979.',SUPPORTS
We didn't have global warming during the Industrial Revolution,SUPPORTS
"For example, geothermal energy is available at all times, concentrated solar thermal energy has storage capability, and wind energy can be stored in compressed air.",SUPPORTS
The latest IPCC report foresees a future if we limit global heating to 1.5°C instead of the 2°C Paris Agreement.,REFUTES
"there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica, and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone.",REFUTES
This small warming is  likely a result of the natural alterations in global ocean currents  which are driven by ocean salinity variations.,SUPPORTS
"temperatures were 6-10C above normal over most of France, Germany and northern Spain during the final days of the month, according to C3S.",NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
Any action by Australia to reduce emissions of fossil fuels would not help to protect the reef unless there is an effective international agreement by major emitters.,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
Modellers assume carbon dioxide drives climate change,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
"Rapid assessment of average temperatures in France between 26-28 June showed a “substantial” increase in the likelihood of the heatwave happening as a result of human-caused global warming, experts at the World Weather Attribution group said.",NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
"The raw data, the actual data from the thermometer[...] show that the United States has been cooling for 80 to 90 years, but the graphs they publish to the public show a warming trend, all because they have changed the data.",REFUTES
"A major part of the climate change bill sponsored by Sens. John Kerry and Joe Lieberman ""was essentially written by BP.""",NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
"This provides a direct, empirical causal link between CO2 and global warming.",SUPPORTS
There is long-term correlation between CO2 and global temperature; other effects are short-term.,SUPPORTS
Murry Salby finds CO2 rise is natural.,REFUTES
"As the temperature has increased, so has the ability of scientists to determine whether specific events are linked to climate change.",SUPPORTS
"While there are uncertainties with climate models, they successfully reproduce the past and have made predictions that have been subsequently confirmed by observations.",REFUTES
Global warming is causing snow to disappear.,SUPPORTS
The temporary drop in sea level in 2010 was due to intense land flooding caused by a strong La Nina.,NOT_ENOUGH_INFO
